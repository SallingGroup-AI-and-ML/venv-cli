# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/tree/develop)

## [v1.4.1](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.4.1) (2023-10-30)

### Bugfixes
* Fixed `venv lock` failing to lock when called as part of `venv install`. [#21](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/pull/21)

## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.4.0) (2023-10-30)

### Minor changes
* `venv sync` command marked as deprecated with removal planned for `v2.0`. Use `venv install <requirements>.lock` instead. [#14](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/pull/14)
* `venv install` now runs `venv clear` before installation. This ensures that the enrivonment doesn't end up with orphaned packages after making changes to `requirements.txt`. [#9](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/issues/9)

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.3.0) (2023-10-30)

### Major changes
* `venv lock` no longer tries to fill in credentials for packages installed via VCS. This behavior was undocumented and difficult to maintain and ultimately tried to alleviate a shortcoming of the way `pip` handles these credentials. [#11](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/pull/11)
For users who have credentials as part of URLs in their `requirements.txt` files, there are other ways to handle credentials, e.g. filling them in `requirements.lock` manually, using a `.netrc` file to store the credetials or using a keyring. See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/authentication/ for more info.

### Minor changes
* `venv create` now prints the full python version used for creating the environment. [bb62c21](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/commit/bb62c216cbad2fcec06bfb1cde8b875dbfc237d3)

### Internal changes
* Added `pytest-cases` to development dependencies.

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.2.0) (2023-08-04)

From this release forward, this project follows the `Git Flow` branching model. To reflect this, the default development branch have been renamed `develop`, and the `main` branch is now only for tagged releases.
To read more about Git Flow, see (https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Also see [README](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/blob/v1.2.0/README.md#git-flow) for branch naming conventions.

* Changed github test workflow to reflect new branch naming conventions.
* Added better, context-based bash completions.

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.1.0) (2023-08-02)

### New install script
This release adds an `install.sh` script for easier installation of `venv-cli`. Now it can be installed by simply running
```console
$ bash install.sh
```

For more information on installing and uninstalling, see the updated [README](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/blob/v1.1.0/README.md)

### Internal changes

* Added functionality to `venv lock`: Since `pip freeze` (which `venv lock` is using under the hood) does not output the `auth`-part of VCS URLs, `venv lock` now includes a fix that tries to read them from a reference `requirements`-file, but **only if they are specified as environment variables** so as not to accidentally expose secrets in version-controlled `.lock`-files.

For more info on this, see `venv lock --help`.

## [v1.0.2](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.2) (2023-08-02)

* Fixed test that checks the version number follows the required pattern.

## [v1.0.1](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.1) (2023-08-02)

* Added support for `zsh` shell.
* Added `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (2023-07-13)

This is the first release of the `venv-cli` tool.
